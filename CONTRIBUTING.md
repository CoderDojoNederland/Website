Some ground rules

1. Keep all commits, comments, descriptions, etc. in English
2. Fork the Repo and send a pull request
3. Always add a description in your pull request
4. Use the labels (`Work In Progress`, `Ready For Review`, `Ready For Merge`, `Needs Work`)
5. Make sure you write according unit tests to your code
6. We stick with [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) as much as possible

Once your PR has been reviewed and approved it will be merged and deployed to production.
